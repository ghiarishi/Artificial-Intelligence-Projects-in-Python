# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects-in-Python

This repository serves as a collection of all my Artificial Intelligence based projects, each written in Python3. 

Throughout, I have aimed to use incrasingly complex algorithms including the ones listed below to solve basic real world problems, or play rather interesting games in order to hone my skills: 

a. Breadth First Search

b. Depth First Search 

c. Min-Max search

d. Alpha-Beta Pruning

e. A* Search 

f. Markov Model

g. Reinforcement Learning

Some of the games that I have played and puzzles that I've solved using these algorithms are: 

a. N Queens

b. Lights Out

c. Linear Disk Movement

d. Tile Puzzle

e. Grid Navigation

f. Dominoes Game

g. Sudoku

h. Gridworld
